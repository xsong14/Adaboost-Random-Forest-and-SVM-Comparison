# Adaboost-Random-Forest-and-SVM-Comparison
This Project focus on performing various of classification algorithms in bank marketing field. The class to be predicted is binary, which is 
positive response or negative response. I consider normalizing the dataset and using sampling method to balance the data. 
Then I choose Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, Adaboost and SVM to build classifier model. Use accuracy, sensitivity, ROC curve, 
AUC and complexity to evaluate the performance of each model, and finally get the best one among them.
